# Flask-template

A basic Flask app starter template using an application factory and blueprints.

## Prerequisites: you must have at least Python 3.6 and virtualenv installed.

(1) Clone this repository and enter its directory

```
git clone git@github.com:RyanMcCarl/flask-template.git
cd flask-template
```

(2) Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install dependencies:

```
virtualenv venv --python=python3.6
source activate venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(3) Run the server from the base directory `flask-template`:

```
python run.py runserver
```

# Acknowledgments:

Many concepts and code in this basic app come from Miguel Grinberg's excellent "Flask Web Development". I also highly recommend the YouTube videos on Flask by PrettyPrinted.
